libfdt++
========

* github CI task to run on linux & windows
* property set/get for std::span<uint32_t>, std::span<uint64_t>?
  - maybe a nice way to get/set reg properties?
* return a range from as_stringlist (transform? filter?)
* memory reservation block
* boot cpuid
* inplace load
  - we could avoid making copies of the FDT data by storing & returning
    references to the FDT memory.
